        <div class="blog-content2 col-6 m-auto px-20 py-40 text-125 text-justify">
            <p>ON A WARM Paris night this past July, in the same neo-Classical palace off the Place de la Concorde where coronation balls were once held for Emperor Napoleon I and King Charles X, Balenciaga was hosting a dinner for Demna, its artistic director of seven years. Earlier that day, the 41-year-old Georgian designer had presented his second couture collection for the French fashion house founded in 1917 by Cristóbal Balenciaga, the Spanish designer whose bubble hemlines, sack dresses and cocoon coats offered an adventurous postwar alternative to Christian Dior's hyper-feminine New Look of the late 1940s. Now, in a grand reception room of the recently restored 18th-century Hôtel de la Marine, the magician David Blaine was performing a card trick for the pop star Dua Lipa; the actor Alexa Demie was chatting with the reality star and real estate agent Christine Quinn, whose Balenciaga handbag, one of only 20 in existence, was also a Bang & Olufsen speaker; and Kim Kardashian, the brand's most loyal and most famous customer, posed in one of the designer's tinted polyurethane face shields, which made her look like she'd stepped out of a John Baldessari photograph.</p>
            <p>Demna was seated at a long banquet table with Kardashian; her mother, Kris Jenner; the actor Michelle Yeoh; the supermodels Naomi Campbell and Bella Hadid; the rapper Offset; the country musician Keith Urban; and his wife, the movie star Nicole Kidman, who'd walked her first runway show a few hours earlier in a silver-coated silk taffeta gown with a long train knotted at the hip. To allay his sometimes-severe social anxiety at such events, Demna has always surrounded himself with a circle of confidants — including his husband, the composer and musician Loïck Gomez, also known by his stage name, BFRND, whom he met online in 2016 and married in 2017. But after weekly sessions with his life coach, he decided to try exposure therapy this time. (He's been working with the same therapist since just before starting at Balenciaga; often he finds it easier to communicate emotion through a garment he's made than with words.) “Am I going to say something wrong to Nicole?” he worried. But when I glanced over to check on him, I saw that Demna was face to face with Kidman, whom he'd only just met. Her hand was on his heart, and his hand on hers, neither of them moving or speaking. They stayed like that, silent and staring at each other, for almost two minutes; it's her preferred way of connecting to someone, she says.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Across the room at the friends' table, I found myself where Demna would usually be, with the painter Eliza Douglas, Demna's longtime muse; her partner, the artist Anne Imhof; the pop singer Róisín Murphy, who would later perform a few songs in the courtyard; the model Julia Nobis; the photographer Nadia Lee Cohen, who shot Balenciaga's fall 2022 campaign; Martina Tiefenthaler, the company's chief creative officer and one of the founding members of Vetements, the influential fashion collective Demna started in 2014; and Tiefenthaler's boyfriend, Gian Gisiger, the graphic designer behind the latest iteration of Balenciaga's logo. Among other things, Demna is known for being loyal to his tribe, a creative gang — and informal focus group — of like-minded nonconformists who walk in his shows, star in his look books and cheer him on. “What a crazy carnival of people,” Tiefenthaler said to me with pride. “And there he is, in the middle of it all.” She motioned in the direction of the designer, whose gray cotton hoodie stood out amid all the sequins.</p>
            <h5 class="col-8 my-40 m-auto mr-0 text-right">His sense of alienation isn't incidental to his work or a talking point on a press release; it's visible in every garment he makes — if you know where to look.</h5>
            <p>Demna was hired by Balenciaga in 2015 with a clear mandate: to make the clothes feel urgent again. As an heir to the legendary tailor once described by Dior as “the master of us all” and by Coco Chanel as “a couturier in the truest sense of the word” — as well as a more immediate successor to the urbane, forward-thinking French Belgian designer Nicolas Ghesquière, who spent 15 years at the brand's helm before departing in 2012 — he was not an obvious choice. Cristóbal Balenciaga was a perfectionist intent on achieving sculptural purity through minimal construction, a feat he came closest to realizing in his spring 1967 collection, which included a wedding dress held together by a single seam. Demna, who looks like a headbanger, in torn jeans and ratty band T-shirts, with piercings in both ears, seemed to have emerged onto fashion's biggest stage straight from a Rammstein concert.</p>
            <div class="my-40">

            </div>
            <p>But since his appointment at Balenciaga, Demna has become, if not his generation's most important designer, certainly its most exciting. In an industry where strategy teams struggle to get people talking about their brands, he can't release a pair of shoes without them turning into a Cardi B lyric. What's more striking, though, is how dexterously he has exhumed the archives, reinterpreting Cristóbal's classic silhouettes with cheek and reverence, splicing house codes with streetwear style principles, making haute couture not just from satin and velvet but nylon and denim, as well. His contributions to the house have ranged from homage (his fall 2016 debut opened with a two-button gray flannel jacket that flared at the hips, a subtle take on the trademark Balenciaga bell shape of the 1950s) to histrionic (for spring 2020, he took the construction to its extreme, exaggerating the form so that models in matching gold and silver lamé gowns resembled a pair of Hershey's Kisses on creatine).</p>
            <p>Much as he might want to recede at times, Demna has found himself ever more scrutinized. In this way, too, he recalls his predecessor: Back in the 1940s and '50s, Balenciaga the man became an international fashion star despite his best attempts at anonymity. As Mary Blume, author of “The Master of Us All: Balenciaga, His Workrooms, His World” (2013), told NPR, “Nobody knew how tall he was, if he was slim or fat. … Several French journalists thought he wasn't one person but that he was a team of designers. And this is simply because he did not appear.” In 2021, Demna attended the Met Gala with Kardashian, both in matching black fabric face coverings. Although his attendance was meant to signal his emergence as an industry star, many people speculated that it was Kanye West, Kardashian's estranged husband at the time. Still, the mask served at least two purposes: Wearing it calmed his nerves, and it prevented the flashing cameras from capturing unflattering photos of him. “I've always had a problem with myself in the mirror,” says Demna, whose somewhat stern features — pale skin, strong nose — are softened by his hazel eyes and a warm smile. Since then, he's chosen to wear one whenever he has to have his picture taken.</p>
